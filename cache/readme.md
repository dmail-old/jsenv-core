# cache/

This folder speed up things by caching many output such as polyfill builds or transpiled files.
Most cache folders and files are ignored by .gitignore because this is dynamic content.

## features.js

Cached transpiled version of features.js.
feature.js is transpiled because it uses template literals to be more readable.
